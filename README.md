### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm MEHMET SÄ°NAN
 In 2016, I graduated from Suleyman Demirel University with a degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. In order to enhance my professional skills, I worked in various jobs, but I realized that my true interest lies in software. In 2019, I took Microsoft expertise training at Bilge Adam Academy, where I gained knowledge and skills in C#, .NET, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS technologies. Later, based on a recommendation from a friend, I came across the platforms FolksDev and Patikayla.dev, which offer free training courses. These platforms sparked my desire to learn new technologies.

The prevalence of Java as the backend technology used by development companies and its large community motivated me to learn Java. I have learned Java and continue to expand my knowledge in this area. I have an interest in every aspect of software development.
